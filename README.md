### IMPORTANT: I forked this to fix some annoyances and add functionality to Av1ador _FOR MY OWN PERSONAL USE CASE_ (video encoding with SVT-AV1-PSY and Opus 2.0 downmixed for audio), not with the intention to continue development. Some old features have been removed and some might be broken, including support for some other codecs. Therefore, consider this fork as pre-Alpha, stability wise. Stick to the original repo unless you know what you're doing!
