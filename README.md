### IMPORTANT: I forked this to fix some annoyances and add some missing functionalities to Av1ador _FOR MY OWN PERSONAL USE CASE_ (video encoding with SVT-AV1-PSY and Opus 2.0 downmixed for audio) and not with the intention to continue development of the original repo. Some old features have been removed and some others might be broken, including support for other codecs. Therefore, consider this fork as pre-Alpha stability wise. Stick to the original repo unless you know what you're doing!
